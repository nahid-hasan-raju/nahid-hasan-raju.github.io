          <p class="lead mb-5">
            I believe in personal growth and how the effects of our experiences shape our character and personality. From birth to 27 my life has troubled my mind,
             but today I see growth, and see the endless possibilities that life can hold for me.

            As a child, I grew up in a broken home that was drug infested and often filled with strangers. My mother left my father before 
            I was old enough to know his face because she says he beat her and became addicted to drugs.
            She moved us to a house on her parent’s trucking business yard that was set up like a community with three houses and a trailer on the property.
            A couple of the truck drivers lived in the other houses with their families. I didn’t know it at the time, but they all used and abused drugs, including my mother. 
            Being a young child my mom meant the world to me and I wanted to spend every second with her. 
            My heart broke every time she left the house and wouldn’t come home for a day or sometimes a few days. 
            My brother and I were hardly ever left with food or someone to look after us. Through this type of environment we seeped in sadness and anger.

            The next stage of my life was at the age of twelve when I became involved in selling and using drugs. 
            My mother was using them, followed by my brother, so why not me, too. We were living precisely as she had unconsciously raised us, 
            not going to or caring about school, using drugs and selling them to whomever for the love of money. Kids love money, and we were making a lot of it.
            I honestly believed in my mind that the life I was living at this time was acceptable. I, just like my mother, began to spend days away from home sleeping on people’s floors,
              wandering the streets, all to obtain the drug that my life was formed around. One day, my eyes saw from one room to the next, my brother crying a puddle of tears, 
              begging our mother to help him escape the drug that was killing his mind. That moment changed my perception.

            Stage three started at fourteen years old when I got my first job at McDonald’s and started back to school.
            I chose independent study so I could work full-time and continue my education. My focus was work, work, and more work,
              and I learned I had the skills and ability to do something positive with my life and earn an honest living. I was a McDonald’s manager at fifteen years old, which was illegal,
              but the owner trusted me enough to run his business which gave me confidence in my actions and decision making.

            Two years later I moved up to the grocery business where I met a man named Paul, my boss, 
            but he also became a father figure to me. Paul was a college graduate who majored in psychology, but landed in the grocery business. We developed a close relationship. 
            Through Paul and many others I was learning and seeing a better reality. There were differences evolving in my behavior, beliefs, and motivations to life.

            Today I’m twenty seven years old and have an understanding of my childhood and what my mother went through as a child and why she became a drug abuser.
            However, it’s my personal growth that contributed to who I chose to become and how I represent myself to the world. Regardless of my situation 
            I grew to live a positive and caring life through the knowledge of my experiences and open mindedness. Each day that I learn and live; I continue to grow as a person.
